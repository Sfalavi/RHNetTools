<h2>Creates a tibble of SIDs x houses in each wave</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a tibble of SIDs x houses in each wave
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
makeSIDInAnyWave(pInLst)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pInLst</code></td>
<td>
<p>(list) A list of tbls, one for each wave of interest,
with columns SID and HID, e.g. as created by 'makeSIDHIDLookups'.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the individual was not a resident anywhere (i.e. not in the
study), the value for that SID and wave is NA. If the individual switched
houses while surveys were in progress, it is possible he/she could have
had a longNet row from two houses; however, he/she could only have
surveyed in one, and this is the one that should be assigned to that SID.
If such a switch occurred but the individual did not survey in either
house (we've never seen this but it's possible), then if that SID is to
be included for some reason (normally one would not),
then an ad hoc decision must be made in the data prep script.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a single tbl (tbl_df) with one row for any of the SIDs
found in pInLst, and 1 column for each wave, containing the HID the
the individual was considered to have been living in for that wave.
