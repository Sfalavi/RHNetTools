<h2>Makes an adjacency matrix from an edge list, with SID-labeled rows/cols</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Makes an adjacency matrix from an edge list, with SID-labeled rows/cols
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
makeAdjMatrix(
  rlpNetAllWaves,
  pWave = 0,
  includeAltID = FALSE,
  not_active_code = 10
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rlpNetAllWaves</code></td>
<td>
<p>An edge list network of the form created by
'getNet4OneRlp', i.e. a tbl_df, with cols: SID, HID, WID, AltID, and
one of: friend, loan, help, conv, advc, rate. If for one wave of a
multiwave set, this tbl MUST include all edges for all waves
(see 'details' for explanation).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pWave</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value indicating which WID to use from rlpNet, if the
latter includes multiple waves (which it should, generally, when creating
network matrices for a multiwave analysis; see 'details' for more on this)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>includeAltID</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default=FALSE. If TRUE, both AltIDs and SIDs are
included in the output matrix, so that individuals who do not appear
as a chooser (SID) might still be included in the output. If FALSE,
only choosers (with an SID in rlpNet) will be included; any links
to AltIDs who are not also SIDs are ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>not_active_code</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default=10. This is the code put into the adjacency
matrix if the individual represented by that row &amp; column did not
contribute network data during wave 'pWave'</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function does not break up rlpNet in any way; that is, it
returns a single matrix, with 1's where SID chose AltID, and 0's
otherwise.<br />
*Importantly*, if this function is being used to create a network
matrix for a particular wave of a multiwave analysis, and if also
included SIDs do not necessarily appear in all waves (which is typical),
the input tbl (rlpNetAllWaves) must include the data for the entire
analysis, i.e. all edges for all waves.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of dim unique(SID) (or if includeAltID=TRUE, of
unique(SID U AltID)), containing the values appearing in col 5 of
rlpNet, and with rownames = colnames = the original ID values (SID
&amp;/or AltID), to identify which rows and columns refer to which individuals
in rlpNet.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function *does not* add structural zeros between individuals in
different houses. For that, create a network set and input it to
the function 's0Fill'; you get output in the same format, but with the
structural zeros added.
