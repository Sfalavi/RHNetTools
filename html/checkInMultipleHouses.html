<h2>Check possible multiple house membership within 1 wave.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check possible multiple house membership within 1 wave.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
checkInMultipleHouses(rlpNet, pWave = 0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rlpNet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(tbl_df) A tbl in 'longNet' or 'rlpNet' format. Can include
multiple waves but only one will be processed (see 'pWave' doc).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pWave</code></td>
<td>
<p>(scaler, default=0) The wave to select. If default, function
assumes rlpNet is for 1 wave only, &amp; that is the wave to use. Otherwise
the function will throw an error.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>SIDs can be assigned to multiple houses in a given wave either
because of an incorrect manual input to the database, or (more
typically) because the SID actually was a member of multiple
houses during the wave survey period, and ended up being surveyed
in several houses (theoretically this shoudld not happen&ndash;RAs should
check first if they've been surveyed since the wave began), or
because they were on two or more house rosters (this should not
happen either, actually; RAs should first that the current
roster is accurate before each survey).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tbl_df of all unique SID-HID combinations where the SID
appeared in more than one house as chooser, chosen, or both. The
columns 'ego' and 'alt' are 1 or 0, respectively, depending on
whether SID was a chooser (ego) and/or chosen (alt) in that
particular house.
