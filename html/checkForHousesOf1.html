<h2>Check for houses with just 1 network member</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check for houses with just 1 network member
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
checkForHousesOf1(rlpNet)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rlpNet</code></td>
<td>
<p>a tbl_df in 'longNet' or 'rlpNet format.
This table can contain any number of waves, but if there is more than
one wave, the check will be done within wave, i.e. so the user
can be sure that no single wave has a house with just one member surveyed.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In such cases there is no 'network', so they should be excluded
from any network analysis. Usually this should not arise but it can
if individuals were excluded from a supposed-final analysis set because,
e.g., they did not have enough observations (say, 2 or more across all
waves) to be included.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tbl_df containing WID, and HID for any individuals &amp;
waves where the individual was the only one in his/her house.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This check is important to run before taking any network set into
production analyses, because other data corrections can create houses
of size 1 as a 'side effect' that may not otherwise be obvious.
