<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Make a w-length list of SID-HID lookup tables from a w-length list of
edge-format tibbles (each of which, e.g., created by 'makeLongNet')
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
makeSIDHIDLookups(tbList, includeAltID = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tbList</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of tibbles, one for each wave, in the format created
by 'makeLongNet'. The data must have columns named SID and HID,
representing ego and house, AltID for alter (if 'includeAltID' = TRUE)
and WID for wave.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>includeAltID</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, default=FALSE. If set to TRUE, the
output lookup tables will include individuals who were chosen
as alters (in 'AltID' col), but may not have been egos (in
'SID' col), implying they did not survey that wave. Normally
this is not desired.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Length of the input list must be &gt;= 1. If includeAltID=FALSE,
the resulting output lists will only include individuals who actually
surveyed on the wave in question. Otherwise it may include some
house residents who were nonparticipants.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If w is the number of distinct waves (WID), i.e. the length of
the input list, a w-length list of SID-HID lookup data.tables is returned,
showing SID membership in each house for each wave. Within a wave, any SID
belong to one and only one HID.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Because an analysis cannot meaningfully include an individual who is
in more than one house, the function will not work if such a condition is
found. Thus, the input 'tbList' elements must already have been filtered
to remove cases where an individual appears in more than one house.
