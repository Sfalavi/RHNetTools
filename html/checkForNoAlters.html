<h2>Check individuals who were only egos in a house (never alters).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check individuals who were only egos in a house (never alters).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
checkForNoAlters(rlpNet, pWave = 0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rlpNet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(tbl_df) A tbl in 'longNet' or 'rlpNet' format. Can include
multiple waves but only one will be processed (see 'pWave' doc).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pWave</code></td>
<td>
<p>(scaler, default=0) The wave to select. If default, function
assumes rlpNet is for 1 wave only, &amp; that is the wave to use. Otherwise
the function will throw an error.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Because house residents are asked to rate all other residents on
study relationship criteria, there should never be a case where someone
did a survey, but was not named as an alter by anyone. This check also
covers the situation where only 1 individual was surveyed in a house
(in that instance, there will be just 1 ego, though possibly
multiple alters)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tbl_df containing SID, HID, and WID for any individuals &amp;
waves where the individual did a survey, but never appears as an
alter (AltID) in the input table.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Only within a wave does it make sense to assume that all egos should
be chosen by at least some (same-house) alters.
