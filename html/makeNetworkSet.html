<h2>Make an 'Analysis Set' list of 'network' or matrix -class networks.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes 'long' format network data (from 'makeLongNet') in a
class 'tibble' (tbl_df) form, and creates a #wave-length list of
class = matrix (or class =network) networks for the requested
relationship type and set of requested waves.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
makeNetworkSet(
  pInTB,
  pWavVec = c(1),
  pTypNet = "FR",
  pTypOut = "MX",
  pTHold = 0,
  includeAltID = FALSE,
  not_active_code = 10
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pInTB</code></td>
<td>
<p>(tbl_df) A long-format tibble, i.e. as created by
'makeLongNet'. This table will usually include several waves, but it
does not have to. <br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: It is assumed that all of the SIDs (and, if
includeAltID=TRUE, AltIDs) in this tbl are exactly the ones you
want in your final data analysis set; thus, any pruning of these
IDs must have occurred prior to running this function.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pWavVec</code></td>
<td>
<p>(numerical vector, default c(1)) A vector of waves to pull
from pInTB.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pTypNet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character string, default = &quot;FR&quot;) Specifies type of network
relationship to use to construct the network. Possibilities are: <br />
FR: friend (1=close friend,2=friend, 3=acquaintence,
4=stranger,5=adversary) <br />
LO: loan $ (1=$0, 2=$10, 3=$50, 4=$100, 5=$500) <br />
HE: help   (1=very likely, 2=likely, 3=maybe, 4=prob not, 5=no) <br />
CO: conversation (1=daily, 2=almost daily, 3=every few days, 4=weekly,
5=almost never) <br />
AD: advice from (1=very often, 2=quite often, 3=regularly, 4=rarely,
5=never) <br />
ST: strength (1=very strong, 2=strong, 3=weak, 4=none, 5=negative)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pTypOut</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character string, default &quot;MX&quot;) MX for matrix output, or
&quot;NT&quot; for 'network' class output.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pTHold</code></td>
<td>
<p>(number, default 0) Threshold for recoding a relationship
value (selected with pTypNet) to 0 or 1. If 1-5, it means 'this value or
higher = 1; else 0'. If &lt;0, the meaning is
'this value or lower = 1'. Default is 0, meaning 'do not recode;
just return the originally-coded rating'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>includeAltID</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical; default=FALSE). If TRUE, any individuals
who appear in pInTB as AltIDs only (chosen by some SID) are
to be included in the analysis even if they never appear as
choosers (SIDs). According to project conventions, this implies
that such individuals would not have participated in the survey for
the wave in question, and thus would have only incoming relationship
ratings. (Normally such data is not included, but it might be, for
example if one wanted to impute outgoing ties for such individuals,
etc.)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>not_active_code</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default=10. This is the code put into the adjacency
matrix if the individual represented by that row &amp; column did not
contribute network data during wave 'pWave'</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A length(pWavVec+1)-length list of wave-specific matrices, in
standard base R 'matrix' format (adjacency matrix). The
w+1st element is a tibble with a row for every SID in the analysis,
plus a column for each wave with the house (HID) the person was
assigned to that wave. This value is NA if and only if the person
did not participate in that wave.
